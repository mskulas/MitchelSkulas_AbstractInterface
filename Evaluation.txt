Abstract pros:
- Easier to conceptualize
- Feel like it does more to set up a framework for classes
Abstract Cons:
- Less flexible
- Fixed methods and attributes

Interface pros:
- Modular, more flexible
- Polymorphism is easier to implement
Interface cons:
- You have to define the framework for every class
- Less substantial when setting up a template for classes

AI Reflection: It was just the autocomplete. Took it line by line. I didn't prompt it at all so it would recommend something and I'd accept or fix it. It did weird things occasionally like say it was drawing a thing and then not actually doing it.
